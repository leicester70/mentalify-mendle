# Mendle

> What is this crap?

This, my friend, is a prototype for my dumb assignment from my "Project ID" module. It is a ridiculous module that all students in my trade school.

Okay, shit talk aside, I found it to be an opportunity to practice what I've learnt during my internship (I was mostly working on Front-End Development, React) and Developed this project using [React](https://https://reactjs.org/) and [MUI](https://) component library. Just look at the dependencies in `package.json` will you?

It is amateur work. Amateur work that I'm proud of.

Also, I am taking this chance to learn GitHub Projects, Issues, and shit like pull requests. I always see them at work and need hand holding. Like what the fuck, I want to learn how to do it too.

> Okay seriously, what is this used for?

To the best of my undestanding,

_I think,_

This is an app for depressed employees within a organization/company to seek help or voice out their mental-wellness needs. Anonymously.

Why? The assumption was that,

- it wasn't ideal for an employee to voice their concerns to peers/colleagues as it might affect their image. You know, office politics and shit.
- okay there were more reason, I just can't remember them. _This shows how much I care about the assignment's context._

The solution here is to have organizations/companies to sign up with Mendle. Once a organization/company signs up with this made up platform, employees within are allowed to be anonymously matched with a medical professional, like a psychologist, or a counsellor. Whatever, you get it.

> Why is your documentation like this?

I am treating this like a journal. lol

# Minimal Viable Product

Why do I need to determine what is minimally viable? It is because I am overkilling this by making this prototype in React. I could've just made wireframes in Figma or Adobe XD. Instead, I do this, and have a short time frame.
Now I need to, at the very least,

- **get the views working for just the employees**
- followed by the medical professionals
- then finally the company. The company is almost useless here. The only feature I can imagine for the company is signing up for this crap. Its anonymous man, what are they going to see.

# Note to Self

- routing is under `App.js`
- there is a switch statement in `NavBar.js` that help determine which pages/settings should load for employees,

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
